Guess the Number Game
In this interactive game, the user must guess a secret number selected by the computer. The game is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game's functionality.

How It Works:
Random Number Generation: The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) at the start of each game.

User Input: The player inputs their guess in a text box and submits it using a button.

Feedback: After each guess, the game provides feedback:

If the guess is too high or too low.
If the guess is correct, the user is congratulated and given the option to restart the game.
Attempt Limit (Optional): Players have a limited number of attempts (e.g., 5 guesses) to guess the correct number before they lose the game.

Styling: The game has a clean and user-friendly design with animations and responsive elements for an enjoyable experience across devices.

Game Reset: After winning or losing, users can reset the game to play again.

This project is great for beginners to practice event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic logic in JavaScript.
